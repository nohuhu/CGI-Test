=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<CGI::Test> module provides a CGI regression test framework which
allows you to run your CGI programs offline, i.e. outside a web server,
and interact with them programmatically, without the need to type data
and click from a web browser.

If you're using the C<CGI> module, you may be familiar with its offline
testing mode.  However, this mode is appropriate for simple things, and
there is no support for conducting a full session with a stateful script.
C<CGI::Test> fills this gap by providing the necessary infrastructure to
run CGI scripts, then parse the output to construct objects that can be
queried, and on which you can interact to "play" with the script's control
widgets, finally submitting data back.  And so on...

Note that the CGI scripts you can test with C<CGI::Test> need not be
implemented in Perl at all.  As far as this framework is concerned, CGI
scripts are executables that are run on a CGI-like environment and which
produce an output.

To use the C<CGI::Test> framework, you need to configure a C<CGI::Test>
object to act like a web server, by providing the URL base where
CGI scripts lie on this pseudo-server, and which physical directory
corresponds to that URL base.

From then on, you may issue GET and POST requests giving an URL, and
the pseudo-server returns a C<CGI::Test::Page> object representing the
outcome of the request.  This page may be an error, plain text, some
binary data, or an HTML page (see L<CGI::Test::Page> for details).

The latter (an HTML page) can contain one or more CGI forms (identified
by C<E<lt>FORME<gt>> tags), which are described by instances of
C<CGI::Test::Form> objects (see L<CGI::Test::Form> for details).

Forms can be queried to see whether they contain a particular type
of widget (menu, text area, button, etc...), of a particular name
(that's the CGI parameter name).  Once found, one may interact with
a widget as the user would from a browser.  Widgets are described by
polymorphic objects which conform to the C<CGI::Test::Form::Widget> type.
The specific interaction that is offered depends on the dynamic type of
the object (see L<CGI::Test::Form::Widget> for details).

An interaction with a form ends by a submission of the form data to the
server, and getting a reply back.  This is done by pressing a submit button,
and the press() routine returns a new page.  Naturally, no server is
contacted at all within the C<CGI::Test> framework, and the CGI script is
ran through a proper call to one of the GET/POST method on the
C<CGI::Test> object.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 Creation Interface

The creation routine C<new()> takes the following mandatory parameters:

=over 4

=item C<-base_url> => I<URL of the cgi-bin directory>

Defines the URL domain which is handled by C<CGI::Test>.
This is the URL of the C<cgi-bin> directory.

Note that there is no need to have something actually running on the
specified host or port, and the server name can be any host name,
whether it exists or not.  For instance, if you say:

    -base_url => "http://foo.example.com:70/cgi-bin"

you simply declare that the C<CGI::Test> object will know how to handle
a GET request for, say:

    http://foo.example.com:70/cgi-bin/script

and it will do so I<internally>, without contacting C<foo.example.com>
on port 70...

=item C<-cgi_dir> => I<path to the cgi-bin directoru>

Defines the physical path corresponding to the C<cgi-bin> directory defined
by the C<-base_url> parameter.

For instance, given the settings:

    -base_url => "http://foo.example.com:70/cgi-bin",
    -cgi_dir  => "/home/ram/cgi/test"

then requesting

    http://foo.example.com:70/cgi-bin/script

will actually run

    /home/ram/cgi/test/script

Those things are really easier to understand via examples than via
formal descriptions, aren't they?

=back

The following optional arguments may also be provided:

=over 4

=item C<-cgi_env> => I<HASH ref>

Defines additional environment variables that must be set, or changes
hardwirted defaults.  Some variables like C<CONTENT_TYPE> really depend
on the request and will be dynamically computed by C<CGI::Test>.

For instance:

    -cgi_env => {
        HTTP_USER_AGENT     => "Mozilla/4.76",
        AUTH_TYPE           => "Digest",
    }

See L<CGI ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES> for more details on which environment
variables are defined, and which may be superseded.

=item C<-doc_dir> => I<path to document tree>

This defines the root directory of the HTTP server, for path translation.
It defaults to C</var/www>.

B<NOTE>: C<CGI::Test> only serves CGI scripts for now, so this setting
is not terribly useful, unless you care about C<PATH_TRANSLATED>.

=item C<-tmp_dir> => I<path to temporary directory>

The temporary directory to use for internal files created while processing
requests.  Defaults to the value of the environment variable C<TMPDIR>,
or C</tmp> if it is not set.

=back

=head2 Object Interface

The following methods, listed in alphabetical order, are available:

=over 4

=item C<GET> I<url_string> [, I<auth_user>]

Issues an HTTP GET request of the specified URL, given as the string
I<url_string>.  It must be in the http scheme, and must lie within the
configured CGI space (i.e. under the base URL given at creation time
via C<-base_url>).

Optionally, you may specify the name of an authenticated user as the
I<auth_user> string. C<CGI::Test> will simply setup the CGI environment
variable C<REMOTE_USER> accordingly.  Since we're in a testing framework,
you can pretend to be anyone you like.  See L<CGI ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES>
for more information on environment variables, and in particular
C<AUTH_TYPE>.

C<GET> returns a C<CGI::Test::Page> polymorphic object, i.e. an object whose
dynamic type is an heir of C<CGI::Test::Page>.  See L<CGI::Test::Page> for
more information on this class hierarchy.

=item C<POST> I<url_string>, I<input_data> [, I<auth_user>]

Issues an HTTP POST request of the specified URL.  See C<GET> above for
a discussion on I<url_string> and I<auth_user>, which applies to C<POST>
as well.

The I<input_data> parameter must be a C<CGI::Test::Input> object.
It specifies the CGI parameters to be sent to the script.  Users normally
don't issue POST requests manually: they are the result of submits on
forms, which are obtained via an initial GET.  Nonetheless, you can
create your own input easily and issue a "faked" POST request, to see
how your script might react to inconsistent (and probably malicious)
input for instance.  See L<CGI::Test::Input> to learn how to construct
suitable input.

C<POST> returns a C<CGI::Test::Page> polymorphic object, like C<GET> does.

=item C<base_path>

The base path in the URL space of the base URL configured at creation time.
It's the URL with the scheme, host and port information removed.

=item C<cgi_dir>

The configured CGI root directory where scripts to be run are held.

=item C<doc_dir>

The configured document root directory.

=item C<host_port>

The host and port of the base URL you configured at creation time.

=item C<split_uri> I<URI>

Splits an URI object into server (host and port), path and query components.
The path is simplified using UNIX semantics, i.e. C</./> is ignored and
stripped, and C</../> is resolved by forgetting the path component that
immediately precedes it (no attempt is made to make sure the translated path
was indeed pointing to an existing directory: simplification happens in the
path space).

Returns the list (host, path, query).

=item C<tmp_dir>

The temporary directory that is being used.

=item C<http_headers>

Returns hashref with parsed HTTP headers received from CGI script.

=back

=head1 CGI ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The CGI protocol defines a set of environment variables which are to be set
by the web server before invoking the script.  The environment created by
C<CGI::Test> conforms to the CGI/1.1 specifications.

Here is a list of all the known variables.  Some of those are marked
I<read-only>.  It means you may choose to set them via the C<-cgi_env>
switch of the C<new()> routine, but your settings will have no effect and
C<CGI::Test> will always compute a suitable value.

Variables are listed in alphabetical order:

=over 4

=item C<AUTH_TYPE>

The authentication scheme used to authenticate the user given by C<REMOTE_USER>.
This variable is not present in the environment if there was no user specified
in the GET/POST requests.

By default, it is set to "Basic" when present.

=item C<CONTENT_LENGTH>

Read-only variable, giving the length of data to be read on STDIN by POST
requests (as told by C<REQUEST_METHOD>).  If is not present for GET requests.

=item C<CONTENT_TYPE>

Read-only variable, giving the MIME type of data to be read on STDIN by POST
requests (as told by C<REQUEST_METHOD>).  If is not present for GET requests.

=item C<GATEWAY_INTERFACE>

The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) version specification.
Defaults to "CGI/1.1".

=item C<HTTP_ACCEPT>

The set of Content-Type that are said to be accepted by the client issuing
the HTTP request.  Since there is no browser making any request here, the
default is set to "*/*".

It is up to your script to honour the value of this variable if it wishes to
be nice with the client.

=item C<HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET>

The charset that is said to be accepted by the client issuing the HTTP
request.  Since there is no browser making any request here, the
default is set to "iso-8859-1".

=item C<HTTP_CONNECTION>

Whether the connection should be kept alive by the server or closed after
this request.  Defaults to "Close", but since there's no connection and
no real client...

=item C<HTTP_HOST>

This is the host processing the HTTP request.
It is a read-only variable, set to the hostname and port parts of the
requested URL.

=item C<HTTP_USER_AGENT>

The user agent tag string.  This can be used by scripts to emit code that
can be understood by the client, and is also further abused to derive the
OS type where the user agent runs.

In order to be as neutral as possible, it is set to "CGI::Test" by default.

=item C<PATH_INFO>

Read-only variable set to the extra path information part of the requested URL.
Always present, even if empty.

=item C<PATH_TRANSLATED>

This read-only variable is only present when there is a non-empty C<PATH_INFO>
variable.  It is simply set to the value of C<PATH_INFO> with the document
rootdir path prepended to it (the value of the C<-doc_dir> creation argument).

=item C<QUERY_STRING>

This very important read-only variable is the query string present in the
requested URL.  Note that it may very well be set even for a POST request.

=item C<REMOTE_ADDR>

The IP address of the client making the requst.  Can be used to implement
an access policy from within the script.  Here, given that there's no real
client, the default is set to "127.0.0.1", which is the IP of the local
loopback interface.

=item C<REMOTE_HOST>

The DNS-translated hostname of the IP address held in C<REMOTE_ADDR>.
Here, for testing purposes, it is not computed after C<REMOTE_ADDR> but can
be freely set.  Defaults to "localhost".

=item C<REMOTE_USER>

This read-only variable is only present when making an authenticated GET or
POST request.  Its value is the name of the user we are supposed to have
successfully authenticated, using the scheme held in C<AUTH_TYPE>.

=item C<REQUEST_METHOD>

Read-only variable, whose value is either C<GET> or C<POST>.

=item C<SCRIPT_FILENAME>

Read-only variable set to the filesystem path of the CGI script being run.

=item C<SCRIPT_NAME>

Read-only variable set to the virtual  path of the CGI script being run,
i.e. the path given in the requested URL.

=item C<SERVER_NAME>

The host name running the server, which defaults to the host name present
in the base URL, provided at creation time as the C<-base_url> argument.

=item C<SERVER_PORT>

The port where the server listens, which defaults to the port present
in the base URL, provided at creation time as the C<-base_url> argument.
If no port was explicitely given, 80 is assumed.

=item C<SERVER_PROTOCOL>

The protocol which must be followed when replying to the client request.
Set to "HTTP/1.1" by default.

=item C<SERVER_SOFTWARE>

The name of the server software.  Defaults to "CGI::Test".

=head1 BUGS

There are some, most probably.  Please notify me about them.

The following limitations (in decreasing amount of importance)
are known and may be lifted one day -- patches welcome:

=over 4

=item *

There is no support for cookies.  A CGI installing cookies and expecting
them to be resent on further invocations to friendly scripts is bound
to disappointment.

=item *

There is no support for plain document retrieval: only CGI scripts can
be fetched by an HTTP request for now.
